# Cars-Showroom
This program simulates a car rental and sales system using a `Cars` class. It allows users to add cars, check the number of available cars for a specific model, rent or buy a car, return rented cars, and display details of a particular car model. The data for each car, such as model, color, engine size, and prices, are stored in vectors, and the program interacts with a file to persistently save added cars. A menu system is implemented to navigate the different operations. The program also includes a discount mechanism for rentals based on the number of rental days.
